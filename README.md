# DSA-Prep
As I revise DSA, goal for this repository is to have a commit every day. 

Goals (Finalize and don't change - as of April 10 2023):
- Improve DSA
- Improve Java
- Improve Leetcode ranking
(note - for basic problems use Java to implement, for the rest, can use python)

So if I'm using a roadmap, starting from level 1(easy problems), then use Java. If I'm picking a topic and covering advanced problem randomly then pick Java. Point is language should not hinder DSA growth. And should not be monotonous by doing Python again and again.
