Problem:
You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the de

Code:
class Solution:
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        def process(unordered):
            rev=[]
            while len(unordered)>0:
                rev.append(unordered.pop(0))
                if len(unordered)>0:
                    unordered.append(unordered.pop(0))
            return rev

        sortedList = sorted(deck.copy())
        indices = [i for i in range(len(deck))]
        revealOrder = process(indices)
        result = [0] * len(deck)
        for i in range(len(revealOrder)):
            idx = revealOrder[i]
            result[idx] = sortedList[i]
        return result

Additional notes:
result represents the final state of the deck:

result is initialized as an empty list of the same length as the deck ([0] * len(deck)).
By keeping revealOrder intact as a sequence of indices, we can directly map sorted card values to their proper indices in result.
Mapping sorted cards to positions:

We iterate through the sorted deck (sortedList) and map each card to its corresponding position in result using the revealOrder indices.
This ensures that every card is placed in the correct position as determined by the reveal order.
Key Benefit of This Approach:
By separating the roles:

revealOrder strictly determines the positions.
result stores the final output.
This avoids overwriting critical information in revealOrder, ensuring correctness and clarity.

Visual Example:
Consider deck = [17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7].

Sorted deck: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
Reveal order (revealOrder): [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
Mapping (using result):
Place 2 (sorted[0]) at position 0 → result = [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Place 3 (sorted[1]) at position 2 → result = [2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Place 5 (sorted[2]) at position 4 → result = [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0]
And so on...
Final result = [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7].

By separating the mapping logic, we ensure the indices are correctly used without being lost during the process.
