Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Solution:
This approach is efficient because it only requires 
O(1) extra space for the pointers and 
O(n) time complexity
where n is the number of elements in the array.

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[0]
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        fast = nums[0]
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]
        return slow
