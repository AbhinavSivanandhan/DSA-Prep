Find all substrings of a given string. Note that the Powerset example would be the first preference, but this is easy too.

Solution:
def findSubstrings(s):
  from collections import Counter
  sl=[]
  for i in range(0,len(s)):
    for j in range(i+1,len(s)+1):
      print(s[i:j])
      
findSubstrings('abcde')
