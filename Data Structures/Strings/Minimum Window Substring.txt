1. Use two pointers: start and end to represent a window.
2. Move end to find a valid window.
3. When a valid window is found, move start to find a smaller window.
To check if a window is valid, we use a map to store (char, count) for chars in t. And use counter for the number of chars of t to be found in s. The key part is m[s[end]]--;. We decrease count for each char in s. If it does not exist in t, the count will be negative.

To really understand this algorithm, please see my code which is much clearer, because there is no code like if(map[s[end++]]++>0) counter++;.
