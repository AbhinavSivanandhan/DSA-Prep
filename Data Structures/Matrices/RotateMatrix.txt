Problem:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, m: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        n = len(m)

        # Transpose the matrix in-place
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                m[i][j], m[j][i] = m[j][i], m[i][j]

        # Reverse each row to get the final rotated matrix
        for i in range(n):
            m[i].reverse()
        return m
