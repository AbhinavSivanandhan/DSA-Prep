## üìù **Problem recap**

Given:

- `times`: list of edges `(u, v, w)` ‚Üí signal from node `u` reaches `v` in `w` time
- `n`: total number of nodes
- `k`: starting node

We need to:

üëâ Compute **minimum time** for all nodes to receive the signal sent from node `k`.

üëâ Return `-1` if some node is unreachable.

## üöÄ **Code with clear comments**

```python
import collections
import heapq

class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: list[list[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Build graph as adjacency list: edges[u] = list of (v, w)
        edges = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            edges[u].append((v, w))

        # Min-heap to prioritize the next node with smallest accumulated time
        # Each element is (current time cost to reach node, node)
        minHeap = [(0, k)]

        # Set of visited nodes to prevent reprocessing
        visit = set()

        # Tracks max time to reach any node (result)
        t = 0

        while minHeap:
            # Pop the node with the smallest time so far
            w1, n1 = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

            # If already visited, skip
            if n1 in visit:
                continue

            # Mark as visited
            visit.add(n1)

            # Update max time so far
            t = w1

            # Check all neighbors of current node
            for n2, w2 in edges[n1]:
                if n2 not in visit:
                    # Add neighbor with updated total time
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (w1 + w2, n2))

        # If all nodes are visited, return time; else, some node is unreachable
        return t if len(visit) == n else -1

```

## üìå **Explanation of key parts**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Graph build**

```python
edges[u].append((v, w))

```

We‚Äôre building an adjacency list where:

- Key = node `u`
- Value = list of tuples `(v, w)` meaning edge to node `v` with weight `w`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Min-heap**

```python
minHeap = [(0, k)]

```

Min-heap (priority queue) lets us always process the next node that has the shortest time so far (Dijkstra‚Äôs core idea).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Visited set**

```python
visit = set()

```

We only want to process each node once ‚Äî once we know the shortest time to it.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Main loop**

- Pop the node with min time
- If already visited, skip
- Else:
    - Mark as visited
    - Update max time
    - Add its neighbors to the heap with updated times

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Final check**

```python
return t if len(visit) == n else -1

```

If we reached all `n` nodes ‚Üí return the max delay seen.

Else ‚Üí some nodes unreachable ‚Üí return `-1`.

---

## ‚è± **Time and space complexity**

| Aspect | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Time | O(E * log N) ‚Üí E = edges, N = nodes (each edge can cause a heap push; heap ops log N) |
| Space | O(E + N) ‚Üí for graph + heap + visited |

---

## ‚ö° **Summary**

üëâ This is **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** with:

- min-heap to always pick the next closest node
- visited set to process each node once
- final time = the slowest node‚Äôs shortest delay
