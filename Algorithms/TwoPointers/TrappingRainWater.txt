Hint: Similar to container with most water(same two pointer pattern)

Absolutely — let’s go step by step to understand the famous **“Trapping Rain Water”** problem.

---

## 🧠 Problem Intuition

You're given an array of elevations — each value is a vertical bar.

Think of it like a histogram, and **rain falls on it**.

You must compute **how much water is trapped** between the bars after raining.

---

### 💡 Visual

For this input:

```python
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

```

It looks like this:

```
          _
      _  | |
_   | |  | |
| | | |__| |

```

Water gets trapped in **valleys** between higher bars.

---

## 🔎 Observation

At each index `i`, the **water that can be trapped** is:

```
water_at_i = min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]

```

Where:

- `left_max` = tallest bar to the **left** of `i`
- `right_max` = tallest bar to the **right** of `i`

Only when both sides are taller can water stay above `height[i]`.

---

## ✅ Two-Pointer Optimal Solution (O(n) time, O(1) space)

We'll move **two pointers**: one from the left and one from the right.

### 🧠 Key Idea:

- At any point, the **side with the smaller height controls** how much water can be trapped.
- So we move that pointer inward and update `left_max` or `right_max` accordingly.

---

## 🔧 Code (with explanation)

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = height[l], height[r]
        res = 0

        while l < r:
            if left_max < right_max:
                l += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[l])
                res += left_max - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[r])
                res += right_max - height[r]

        return res

```

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Example:

For:

```python
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]

```

We’ll track:

- `l = 0`, `r = 11`
- `left_max = height[0] = 0`
- `right_max = height[11] = 1`

Start comparing `left_max` and `right_max`:

- Since `left_max < right_max`, move left pointer in
- Update `left_max`
- Compute how much water can be trapped at that position
- Repeat until `l >= r`

Eventually, the total trapped water is **6**.

---

## 🧠 Why Does It Work?

- We're always moving the **side with smaller wall height**, because **that side limits the water level**.
- We only add water where `height[i] < current_max`
- By keeping track of current `left_max` and `right_max`, we avoid rescanning the array.

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space

| Complexity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Time | O(n) — one pass |
| Space | O(1) — just pointers and counters |

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This is one of the most elegant two-pointer problems because:

- It’s **pure logic** — no need to use stacks or arrays
- It models the physical intuition of "how water stays trapped"

---

Would you like me to also show the **stack-based approach**, which is often how people solve it first before optimizing to this two-pointer version?

Great — let’s start with the **stack-based approach first**, because it's often easier to **visualize** at first, especially when understanding how rainwater gets trapped between bars.

---

# 💦 Trapping Rain Water – Stack-Based Approach (Intuitive First)

## ✅ Idea:

- You use a **stack** to keep track of the **indices** of bars that might trap water.
- When you find a bar that’s taller than the bar at the top of the stack, it means a **container is formed**, and you can now compute water trapped over the bar at the top.

---

## 🔧 Stack-Based Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        res = 0
        i = 0

        while i < len(height):
            # If current bar is taller than top of stack
            while stack and height[i] > height[stack[-1]]:
                top = stack.pop()

                if not stack:
                    break

                distance = i - stack[-1] - 1
                bounded_height = min(height[i], height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
                res += distance * bounded_height

            stack.append(i)
            i += 1

        return res

```

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation:

| Line | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `stack = []` | Stack holds indices of bars. We use it to find left and right boundaries. |
| `res = 0` | Total water trapped. |
| `i = 0` | Index as we iterate over height array. |

---

### Main loop:

```python
while i < len(height):

```

Walk through the entire height array.

---

### Inner loop:

```python
while stack and height[i] > height[stack[-1]]:

```

We’ve found a **right boundary** taller than the current top of the stack → this means we can now trap water.

---

```python
top = stack.pop()

```

This is the "bottom" bar of the trapped region.

---

```python
if not stack: break

```

No left boundary left → can't trap water.

---

```python
distance = i - stack[-1] - 1
bounded_height = min(height[i], height[stack[-1]]) - height[top]
res += distance * bounded_height

```

- **distance** = width between left and right walls
- **bounded_height** = how much water can sit above `top`
- Add area of trapped water.

---

### Final:

```python
stack.append(i)
i += 1

```

Push current bar’s index to stack and move forward.

---

## 🧠 Visual Example (Partial):

```python
height = [0,1,0,2]

```

- At `i = 3`, height is `2`, stack has index `[1, 2]`
- Pop 2 → top = 0
- Water trapped = width(1) * height(1) = 1 unit

---

# 🧠 Time & Space:

| Complexity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Time | O(n) |
| Space | O(n) for stack |

# ✅ Now the Two-Pointer Code (Efficient Version)

You asked to explain **this code line-by-line**:

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

```

- If the input list is empty, return 0 — no bars, no water.

---

```python
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1

```

- Initialize **two pointers** at both ends of the array.
- `l` = left index
- `r` = right index

---

```python
        left_max, right_max = height[l], height[r]

```

- Track the **tallest bar seen so far** from the left and right
- Why? Because water depends on the **shorter wall** between left and right

---

```python
        res = 0

```

- Accumulates total water trapped

---

### Main Loop

```python
        while l < r:

```

- Move inward until both pointers meet

---

```python
            if left_max < right_max:

```

- This means: the **left side is the limiting factor**
- So we **process left pointer**

---

```python
                l += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[l])

```

- Move left inward
- Update the tallest bar we've seen from the left

---

```python
                res += left_max - height[l]

```

- If `left_max > height[l]`, we can trap water
- Water = difference between current left wall and bar height

---

```python
            else:
                r -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[r])
                res += right_max - height[r]

```

- Otherwise, process the **right** side (when right is smaller)
- Same logic: trap water only if right wall is taller than current bar

---

```python
        return res

```

- Return the total trapped water

---

## 🧪 Example Trace: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`

- Start:
    - `l = 0`, `r = 11`
    - `left_max = 0`, `right_max = 1`
- First iteration:
    - left_max < right_max → move left
    - new l = 1 → height = 1
    - left_max = max(0, 1) = 1
    - trapped = 0
- Continue moving inward, computing trapped water at each index

→ Total trapped = **6**

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space:

| Type | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Time | O(n) — one pass |
| Space | O(1) — only variables |

---

### ✅ Final Recommendation:

- Use the **stack-based** version to understand the concept.
- Use the **two-pointer version** for interviews — it’s cleaner, faster, and more space-efficient.

                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
```
