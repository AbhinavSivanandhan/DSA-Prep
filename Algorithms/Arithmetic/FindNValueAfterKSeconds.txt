class Solution:
    def valueAfterKSeconds(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        # Initialize the first row (0 seconds): all elements are 1
        for i in range(n):
            dp[0][i] = 1
        
        # Fill the dp table for each second up to k
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            # First element of each row remains 1
            dp[i][0] = 1
            for j in range(1, n):
                # Calculate the cumulative sum for the j-th element after i seconds
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % mod
        
        # Return the value of the last element after k seconds
        return dp[k][n - 1] % mod
