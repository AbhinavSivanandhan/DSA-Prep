Question:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nsize=len(nums)
        sum=0
        for i in nums:
            sum = sum ^ i
        for j in range(0,nsize+1):
            sum = sum ^ j
        return sum #returns the only missed number
