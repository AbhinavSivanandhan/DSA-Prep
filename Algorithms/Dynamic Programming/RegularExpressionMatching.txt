.* means . is the preceding character, so we get .. where each . can have its own character, hence we can get ab

Great — the solution you posted is already **correct**, **efficient**, and built using a recursive DFS + memoization approach. It's the standard way to solve this problem.

Let’s go ahead and **explain it in the simplest way**, so it becomes crystal clear to you — line by line.

---

## 🎯 Problem Recap

We're matching a string `s` (like `"aa"`) against a **pattern** `p` (like `"a*"`), where:

- `.` matches **any one character**
- means **zero or more of the preceding character**

Match must be **exactly** from start to end — not partial.

---

## ✅ Solution Idea (Plain Words)

We're going to:

- Start from the first character of `s` and `p`
- At each step, decide:
    1. **Do the characters match** (either exact or with `.`)?
    2. Is the **next char in `p` a** ? If so, we have two choices:
        - Skip `char*` (zero occurrences)
        - Or use it and move forward in `s`

We explore both choices with recursion, and **memoize** results so we don’t redo work.

---

Absolutely — let’s explain your code in **plain, simple words**, like we're teaching it step-by-step to someone new to recursion.

---

## ✅ What are we trying to do?

We’re checking if a string `s` matches a pattern `p` that can include:

- `.` → matches **any one character**
- → means "**zero or more** of the **previous character**"

We have to match **the entire string**, not just part of it.

---

## 🧠 Main idea

We use a **recursive function** that checks:

> “Does the part of s starting at index i match the part of p starting at index j?”
>

We **try all possibilities**, but use a `cache` to **save answers** we've already found — so we don’t repeat work.

---

## ✅ Code (with simple explanation)

```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        m, n = len(s), len(p)
        cache = {}

```

- `m`, `n`: lengths of string and pattern
- `cache`: remembers the result of matching `s[i:]` with `p[j:]`

---

```python
        def dfs(i, j):
            if j == n:
                return i == m

```

- If we’re at the **end of the pattern**, the match is only good if we’re also at the **end of the string**.

---

```python
            if (i, j) in cache:
                return cache[(i, j)]

```

- If we’ve already checked this `(i, j)` combination before, reuse the result.

---

```python
            match = i < m and (s[i] == p[j] or p[j] == ".")

```

- `match` is `True` if:
    - We’re not past the end of `s`
    - The current characters match, or `p[j]` is `.`

---

```python
            if (j + 1) < n and p[j + 1] == "*":

```

- If the **next pattern character is** , we can:
    - **skip** the pattern character and  (zero of that letter)
    - **use** it (if current letters match), and stay on `p[j]` to allow more repeats

---

```python
                cache[(i, j)] = (dfs(i, j + 2) or
                                (match and dfs(i + 1, j)))
                return cache[(i, j)]

```

- **Option 1:** `dfs(i, j + 2)` → skip `'char*'`
- **Option 2:** if `match`, try using `'char*'` to match more of `s`

---

```python
            if match:
                cache[(i, j)] = dfs(i + 1, j + 1)
                return cache[(i, j)]

```

- If current characters match (no  involved), just move forward one step in both `s` and `p`.

---

```python
            cache[(i, j)] = False
            return False

```

- If nothing works, mark it as a failed match and return `False`.

---

```python
        return dfs(0, 0)

```

- Start matching from the beginning of `s` and `p`.

---

## 🔄 Example: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a*"`

- First: `match = True`, next is
- Try:
    - skip `a*` → match "aa" with empty pattern → ❌
    - use `a*` once → match `a` with `a`, then again → now empty string and empty pattern → ✅

Answer: `True`

---

## 🧠 Summary in Plain Words

- The function tries matching the string and pattern **from front to back**
- When it sees , it either:
    - Skips it (0 times)
    - Or uses it (1 or more times, if it matches)
- If a `.` shows up, it matches anything
- We **remember results** to avoid rechecking the same things

Want me to walk through a harder case like `"mississippi"` vs `"mis*is*p*."` line by line?

**Dynamic Programming - Top-Down Approach**

**Time complexity: O(m∗n)**

**Space complexity: O(m∗n)**

Where m is the length of the string s and n is the length of the string p.

```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        cache = {}

        def dfs(i, j):
            if (i, j) in cache:
                return cache[(i, j)]

            if j == len(p):
                return i == len(s)

            match = i < len(s) and (s[i] == p[j] or p[j] == '.')

            if j + 1 < len(p) and p[j + 1] == '*':
                cache[(i, j)] = dfs(i, j + 2) or (match and dfs(i + 1, j))
                return cache[(i, j)]

            if match:
                cache[(i, j)] = dfs(i + 1, j + 1)
                return cache[(i, j)]

            cache[(i, j)] = False
            return False

        return dfs(0, 0)

```
