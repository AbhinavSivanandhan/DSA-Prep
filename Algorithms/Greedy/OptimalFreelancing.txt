Problem and explanation:


The `optimalFreelancing` function aims to maximize the total payment a freelancer can earn given a list of jobs with specified payments and deadlines. Here's a breakdown of the intuition behind the code:

### Problem Understanding

You have a set of freelance jobs. Each job has:
1. A payment amount.
2. A deadline by which the job needs to be completed.

The goal is to schedule these jobs in such a way that you maximize the total payment you receive, given that you can only work on one job per day and you can only complete a job before its deadline.

### Code Explanation

1. **Sort Jobs by Payment (Descending Order)**:
   ```python
   jobs.sort(key=lambda job: job["payment"], reverse=True)
   ```
   - The list of jobs is sorted by payment in descending order. This means you will try to schedule the highest-paying jobs first. The idea is that you want to prioritize high-payment jobs because they contribute more to the total profit.

2. **Initialize the Timeline**:
   ```python
   LENGTH_OF_WEEK = 7
   timeline = [False] * LENGTH_OF_WEEK
   ```
   - The `timeline` array represents each day in the week (7 days in total). `False` indicates that the day is available, while `True` means the day is occupied.

3. **Schedule Jobs**:
   ```python
   for job in jobs:
       maxTime = min((job["deadline"]), LENGTH_OF_WEEK)
       for time in reversed(range(maxTime)):
           if timeline[time] == False:
               timeline[time] = True
               profit += job["payment"]
               break
   ```
   - For each job, determine the latest possible day it can be completed (`maxTime`), which is the smaller of the job's deadline and the number of days in the week.
   - Try to place the job starting from the latest possible day (`time` from `maxTime - 1` down to `0`) to the earliest possible day, checking if that day is available (`False`).
   - If you find an available day, mark it as occupied (`True`) and add the job's payment to the total profit.
   - Stop trying to schedule this job once it has been successfully placed.

4. **Return Total Profit**:
   ```python
   return profit
   ```
   - After all jobs have been considered, the function returns the total profit earned by scheduling the jobs optimally.

### Intuitive Summary

The idea is to:
- Focus first on the most lucrative jobs by sorting them by payment.
- Try to assign each job to the latest possible day before its deadline to maximize the chance of fitting the job into the schedule.
- By always placing jobs in the latest available slot, you leave earlier slots open for potentially lower-paying jobs that may need to be scheduled earlier.

This approach leverages the greedy algorithm paradigm by making local optimal choices (placing the highest-paying job in the latest possible available slot) with the hope that these choices lead to a globally optimal solution.

examples:
Certainly! Here are three concise examples:

### Example 1
**Input:**
```json
[
    {"payment": 100, "deadline": 2},
    {"payment": 200, "deadline": 1}
]
```
**Output:** `300`

### Example 2
**Input:**
```json
[
    {"payment": 50, "deadline": 1},
    {"payment": 150, "deadline": 2},
    {"payment": 200, "deadline": 2}
]
```
**Output:** `350`

### Example 3
**Input:**
```json
[
    {"payment": 70, "deadline": 1},
    {"payment": 60, "deadline": 1},
    {"payment": 50, "deadline": 1},
    {"payment": 40, "deadline": 2}
]
```
**Output:** `110`

code:
def optimalFreelancing(jobs):
    LENGTH_OF_WEEK = 7
    profit = 0
    jobs.sort(key=lambda job: job["payment"], reverse=True)
    timeline = [False] * LENGTH_OF_WEEK
    for job in jobs:
        maxTime = min((job["deadline"]), LENGTH_OF_WEEK)
        for time in reversed(range(maxTime)):
            if timeline[time] == False:
                timeline[time] = True
                profit += job["payment"]
                break
    return profit
