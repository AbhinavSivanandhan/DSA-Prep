There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: 'List[int]', target: int) -> int:
        L, H = 0, len(nums)
        while L < H:
            M = (L+H) // 2
            if target < nums[0] < nums[M]: # -inf
                L = M+1
            elif target >= nums[0] > nums[M]: # +inf
                H = M
            elif nums[M] < target:
                L = M+1
            elif nums[M] > target:
                H = M
            else:
                return M
        return -1
